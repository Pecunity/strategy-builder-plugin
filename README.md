# StrategyBuilderPlugin - ERC6900 Standard

## Overview

The **StrategyBuilderPlugin** is a modular smart contract built on the **ERC6900 standard**, designed to automate and execute **advanced DeFi strategies** seamlessly. This plugin integrates with modular smart accounts, allowing users to create, manage, and automate complex financial strategies such as **vault management, borrowing, leveraged yield farming, and more**.

## Features

âœ… **DeFi Strategy Automation** â€“ Users can define and execute automated strategies involving lending, borrowing, staking, and farming.  
âœ… **Modular & Extensible** â€“ Built within the ERC6900 ecosystem, enabling compatibility with other modular account plugins.  
âœ… **Smart Execution & Conditions** â€“ Allows strategies to execute based on predefined conditions, optimizing yield and efficiency.  
âœ… **Fee Management Integration** â€“ Implements **IFeeController** and **IFeeHandler** to ensure seamless fee handling for automated transactions.

## How It Works

1. **Strategy Creation** â€“ Users define custom strategies that include multiple **DeFi actions** (e.g., borrowing, staking, swapping).
2. **Automated Execution** â€“ The plugin triggers actions based on conditions (e.g., interest rate thresholds, collateral ratios).
3. **Fee Handling** â€“ Ensures fair and transparent fee structures using external controllers and handlers.
4. **Smart Account Integration** â€“ Seamlessly integrates with modular smart accounts, leveraging ERC6900â€™s flexible permissioning system.
